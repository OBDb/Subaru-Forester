# Subaru Forester

This repository contains signal set configurations for the Subaru Forester, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the Subaru Forester.

## Generations

The Subaru Forester has evolved through six distinct generations since its debut in 1997, transitioning from a car-based wagon to a proper crossover SUV while maintaining its core characteristics of standard all-wheel drive and boxer engine configuration.

### First Generation (1998-2002)

The first-generation Subaru Forester debuted as the Streega concept at the 1995 Tokyo Motor Show and became available for sale in Japan in February 1997, reaching the U.S. market later that year for the 1998 model year. Built in the style of a station wagon, the Forester featured a taller stance, higher H-point seating, and a standard all-wheel drive drivetrain. Sharing its platform with the Impreza and using an engine from the Outback, this generation provided plenty of standard features such as power windows, anti-lock brakes, and multi-way adjustable seating. The first generation was known for its car-like handling and was the only crossover not required to have a "higher rollover risk" warning sticker.

### Second Generation (2003-2008)

The second-generation Subaru Forester went on sale for the 2003 automotive model year. It featured an updated design with a larger, boxy body, an enlarged chromed grille, new contoured bumpers above, and redesigned halogen headlamps. Building upon the success of the first generation, the 2003 to 2008 Subaru Forester models featured two available engines, up to 64 cubic feet of storage space, and plenty of premium features. Both models featured 165-hp, 2.5-liter four-cylinder engines. Subaru released the XT trim with a turbocharged 210-hp, 2.5-liter engine in 2004. This generation maintained the wagon-like character while improving safety ratings and adding turbocharged performance options.

### Third Generation (2009-2013)

The third-generation Forester began to move away from a traditional wagon design towards becoming a crossover SUV. It was larger in nearly every dimension and featured a sloping roofline with more cargo space. The third generation featured a major redesign that featured a less boxy exterior, characterized by a sloping roofline and softly rounded curves. With this transformation, the Forester became more of a small modern SUV than a rugged traditional wagon. The third-gen Forester retained its car-like driving demeanor in a taller format and came with two 2.5L boxer-four engines with either 170 hp in naturally aspirated form or 224 hp with a turbocharger. This generation received a mid-cycle refresh for the 2011 model year.

### Fourth Generation (2014-2018)

The Subaru Forester was fully redesigned for the 2014 model year. This fourth-generation Forester grew in length over its predecessor by 1.4 inches; it's also 0.6 inches wider. The fourth-gen redesign kicked off with much sharper looks and the same 170-hp base engine, but now with a choice of six-speed manual or CVT automatic. The turbocharged engine was now a 2.0L, but with more power (250 hp) and in conjunction with the CVT only. This was also the first Forester to get Subaru's X-Mode which utilizes the all-wheel-drive system and traction control to ensure the Forester can tackle off-road terrain. The generation introduced optional EyeSight Driver Assist Technology and saw a mid-cycle refresh for the 2017 model year.

### Fifth Generation (2019-2024)

The fifth-generation Forester was presented on March 28, 2018, at the New York International Auto Show. Like contemporary Subaru models, the fifth-generation model moved the Forester to the Subaru Global Platform. The Forester continues to use the 2.5-liter four-cylinder boxer engine of the previous generation. However, the new engine packs more horsepower (182 instead of 179) and comes with direct injection for better fuel economy. For this generation, Subaru discontinued the 250-hp, 2.0-liter turbo engines and no longer offers a manual transmission. All models now come with a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT). This generation made EyeSight Driver Assist technology standard across all models and received a facelift for the 2022 model year that included the addition of the off-road-focused Wilderness trim.

### Sixth Generation (2025-present)

The compact Forester SUV is all-new for 2025, and it's a dramatic update—at least on paper. This is the two-row, five-passenger Forester's sixth generation, and it offers more passenger space and a quieter ride than the previous model. The 2025 Forester is powered by an updated version of its 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. For 2025, it produces 180 horsepower and 178 lb-ft of torque, which is essentially the same as before. The 2025 Subaru Forester Hybrid is the first model in the Subaru lineup to be powered by a next-generation Subaru series-parallel hybrid powertrain that integrates a 2.5-liter SUBARU BOXER® engine and electric motors with Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive. The hybrid compact SUV delivers 194 total system horsepower, coupling Subaru's legendary off-road capability with up to 40% better fuel efficiency compared to its non-hybrid counterparts. The sixth generation features a completely redesigned exterior with more defined styling while maintaining the Forester's practical dimensions and capabilities.
